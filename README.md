This Bot is currently under heavy development. Will update readme once its ready to be launched.
Meanwhile you can [read the docs](https://igrohan.github.io/IGBot) for this bot (that's under development as well so...)

# To Do 
- some commands don't work, need to fix them.
- extra error checks
- economy system rework (yes im reworking the whole thing that i took weeks to write)
- ofc, add more commands.
